# Statistics

Hereâ€™s an expanded explanation of the topics mentioned:

1. **Descriptive Statistics**:
   - **Measures of Central Tendency**: Mean (average), median (middle value), and mode (most frequent value) summarize the center of a data set.
   - **Measures of Variability**: Variance (how data points differ from the mean) and standard deviation (average distance from the mean) show how spread out the data is.

2. **Probability**: The likelihood of events occurring, used to make predictions and understand the chance of various outcomes.

3. **Distributions**:
   - **Binomial Distribution**: Models the probability of a specific number of successes in a fixed number of trials (e.g., coin flips).
   - **Normal Distribution**: A common distribution where data points are symmetrically distributed around the mean, forming a bell curve.

4. **Hypothesis Testing**: A method for making inferences or decisions about a population based on sample data. It involves testing an initial assumption (null hypothesis) and determining if there is enough evidence to reject it.

5. **Probability Mass Function (PMF)**: Describes the probability of discrete outcomes in a distribution, such as the number of heads in a series of coin flips.

6. **Probability Density Function (PDF)**: Describes the likelihood of continuous outcomes in a distribution, such as the height of individuals in a population.

7. **P-Value**: A measure that helps determine the significance of your results in hypothesis testing. It indicates the probability of obtaining results as extreme as, or more extreme than, those observed, assuming the null hypothesis is true.

8. **Z-Score**: Indicates how many standard deviations a data point is from the mean. It helps standardize scores and compare different data sets.

9. **ANOVA (Analysis of Variance)**: A statistical test used to determine if there are significant differences between the means of three or more groups.

10. **Chi-Square Test**: A test used to determine if there is a significant association between categorical variables. It compares observed frequencies with expected frequencies to assess how well the data fits a theoretical distribution.
